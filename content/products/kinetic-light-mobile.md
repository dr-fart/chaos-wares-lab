The Kinetic Light Mobile transforms air currents into a mesmerizing dance of light and shadow. This carefully balanced sculpture features multiple tiers of reflective elements that rotate independently, each embedded with micro-LEDs that respond to the mobile's motion.

As gentle air currents set the mobile in motion, the LEDs create flowing patterns of light that project onto surrounding surfaces. The interplay between kinetic energy and photonic display demonstrates principles of angular momentum, gyroscopic precession, and energy transfer in a stunning visual format.
