sku: "CW-WC-001"
description: "Optical physics meets fluid dynamics in stunning light patterns"
---

The Rippling Water Caustics device creates the enchanting light patterns you see at the bottom of swimming pools, but in a controlled, desktop environment. This sophisticated optical instrument uses precisely controlled water ripples and focused lighting to generate ever-changing caustic patterns on any surface.

The interplay between fluid motion and light refraction creates hypnotic displays that demonstrate Snell's law, wave optics, and the mathematics of caustic curves. Each ripple bends light in unique ways, creating patterns that are both scientifically fascinating and aesthetically stunning.

## Features
- Precision water ripple generation
- High-intensity LED projection system
- Adjustable caustic intensity
- Multiple ripple pattern modes
- Projection distance up to 10 feet
- Whisper-quiet water circulation
- Dimensions: 12" × 12" × 6"
