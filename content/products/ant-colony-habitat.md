---

The Ant Colony Habitat is our most sophisticated demonstration of emergent behavior and swarm intelligence. This carefully designed ecosystem houses a live ant colony, allowing you to observe how simple individual behaviors give rise to complex collective intelligence.

Watch as thousands of individual ants, following basic local rules, create sophisticated tunnel networks, efficient foraging patterns, and adaptive responses to environmental changes. The habitat includes observation chambers, feeding systems, and environmental controls that let you study emergence, self-organization, and collective decision-making in action.
