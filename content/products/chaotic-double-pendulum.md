The Chaotic Double Pendulum is our flagship demonstration of sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This precision-engineered device consists of two pendulums attached end to end, creating a system that exhibits beautifully chaotic motion.

Watch as tiny differences in starting position lead to dramatically different trajectories. The pendulum traces intricate, never-repeating patterns that exemplify chaos theory's most famous principle: the butterfly effect. Each swing is a unique journey through phase space, creating hypnotic patterns that captivate viewers for hours.
