title: "Turbulent Fluid Vortex"
price: 165.00
sku: "CW-FV-001"
description: "Witness the transition from laminar to turbulent flow"
---

The Turbulent Fluid Vortex demonstrates one of fluid dynamics' most fascinating phenomena: the transition from smooth, laminar flow to chaotic turbulence. This device creates controlled vortices in a transparent cylinder, allowing you to observe the Reynolds number transition in real-time.

Watch as smooth, predictable flow patterns suddenly break down into complex, swirling turbulence. The adjustable flow rate lets you explore the critical threshold where order gives way to chaos, illustrating fundamental principles that govern everything from blood flow to atmospheric dynamics.
